# library_visits
The data collected to create these datasets are reused data that comes from three datasets on the California State Library: Public Library Statistics Portal. The data collected are from three "Ready Reports" that were created over a three-year time span to collect library vising stats. The data collected is intended for those who wish to see visiting trends in California's public libraries from 2016-2019.   This project was created for a University of Washington Winter 2021 Data Curation course (LIS 454).
